    <h1>Campus Parking Problem</h1>
    <p><strong>Author:</strong> Brendon Mustachio</p>
    <p>Students and faculty often struggle to find available parking spots on campus, leading to frustration and wasted time. A real-time parking availability system could help drivers locate open spots more efficiently.</p>
    <p><strong>Who is experiencing the problem?</strong> Students and faculty who drive to school.</p>
    <p><strong>What is the problem?</strong> Lack of available parking spaces with no indicator for open spots.</p>
    <p><strong>Where does it happen?</strong> On campus parking lots and garages.</p>
    <p><strong>Why does it matter?</strong> Late arrivals to class and wasted time looking for parking.</p>
