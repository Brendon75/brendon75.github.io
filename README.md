Brendon Mustachio
  Problem Statement:
	  Students and faculty often struggle to find available parking spots on campus, leading to frustration and wasted time. A real-time parking availability system could help drivers locate open spots more efficiently.
  Who is experiencing the problem:
	  The people who experience this problem the most are those who drive back and forth from school. Students that drive from home who are close or far must deal with the possibility that the parking lots, garages, or      side street spots might all be filled up. This is especially true during the later hours of the day, normally around noon.
  What is the problem:
	  The problem is the lack of available parking spaces in the garages and lots. Every parking area only has a set limit of spaces for students, and there is no indicator to showing how many parking spaces are left in   that parking area.
  Where does the problem present itself:
	  The problem can present itself when a student is arriving at a parking lot that is full, especially when said student is running late for a class, lab, or something else important. When the lots are full it can be   difficult to find another parking lot that might have available space, or being lucky enough to find someone leaving the moment you arrive.
  Why does it matter:
	  It is important for students to find parking suitable for them and their classes, otherwise it could become a problem if these students keep ending up in class late. I believe if there was a system or app that       could identify available parking in a lot then I believe a lot of worry would be solved and students could easily find alternative parking rather than aimlessly driving around and hoping a spot is open in another lot.
